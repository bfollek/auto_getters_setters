# auto_getters_setters

Use a metaclass to automatically generate getters and setter methods. I wrote this [years ago](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/307969-generating-getset-methods-using-a-metaclass/). Updated for Python 3.

(I never used this in production code; I just wanted to play with metaclasses.)
